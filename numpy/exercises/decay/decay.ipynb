    "Radioactive decay is a process where an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. This process is fundamentally probabilistic. For a single unstable nucleus, we can only know the *probability* that it will decay in a given time interval; we can never know for sure *when* it will decay.\n",

    "In this exercise, we will use `numpy.random` to simulate the decay of a large sample of radioactive nuclei."
